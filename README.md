# Defect Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Defect Prediction Model. The goal of this project is to predict software defects using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data, the model aims to identify patterns that are indicative of potential defects in software.

## Features
- **Data preprocessing and feature extraction**: Clean and transform raw data into a suitable format for model training.
- **Model training and evaluation**: Train machine learning models and evaluate their performance using various metrics.
- **Visualization of results**: Generate visualizations to interpret the model's predictions and performance.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amishkr22/defect-prediction-model.git
cd defect-prediction-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Prepare your dataset**: Place your dataset in the `data` directory. Ensure the dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV).
2. **Run the preprocessing script**: This script will clean the data and extract relevant features.
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```
3. **Train the model**: Use the preprocessed data to train the machine learning model.
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
4. **Evaluate the model**: Assess the model's performance using the evaluation script.
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```
5. **Visualize the results**: Optionally, generate visualizations to better understand the model's predictions.
    ```bash
    python visualize.py
    ```
